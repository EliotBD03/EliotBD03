### Hi there, I'm Julien or EliotBD03 :wave:

## I'm a student !
    - I'm currently doing a bachelor's degree in computer science aka the best studies 💻 
    - I just finished my first year 1️⃣
    - I would like to make an Erasmus in the trinity college of Dublin to improve my skills in English 🇬🇧
    - I would like to be the greatest student in my class too 👨‍🎓

## My first project 🎮
    During our first year in CS. We had to make a puzzle game in java. This game called BabaIsYou was a very
    interessant algorithmic problem because the rules of the game were inside the game ! 
    My grade for this was 16/20 which is a great note for me. 
    Now we talked about that, let's take a look at this project !
